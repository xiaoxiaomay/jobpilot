# 🔗 LinkedIn Profile Optimization — Xiaoxiao Wu

## Strategy Overview

Your LinkedIn serves THREE purposes simultaneously:
1. **被招聘者搜索到** — 关键词密度要高，让recruiter搜 "data scientist Vancouver" 时能找到你
2. **通过社交信号建立信任** — 弥补"没有本地经验"的短板
3. **作为你简历的补充** — 展示简历上放不下的项目和思考深度

---

## 1. HEADLINE（最重要的120个字符）

LinkedIn搜索算法重度依赖headline。你的headline需要包含recruiter会搜索的关键词。

### 推荐选项（选一个）

**Option A — Data Scientist导向（推荐）：**
```
Data Scientist | ML/DL, NLP, GNN | Python, SQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch | Ex-Uber, Ex-PwC | M.S. CS @ NYIT Vancouver
```

**Option B — 多面手导向：**
```
Data Scientist & AI Strategist | ML · Deep Learning · NLP · Causal Inference | 10+ Yrs Across Finance, InsurTech & Consulting
```

**Option C — 如果你更想attract AI Consultant类工作：**
```
AI/ML Consultant | Building AI-Driven Products & Data Strategies | Ex-Uber · Ex-PwC | Python, NLP, RAG, Graph Neural Networks
```

### Headline关键设计原则
- 以目标职位title开头（"Data Scientist"）— 这是recruiter的主要搜索词
- 包含3-5个高频搜索技能词
- 提到知名公司（Uber, PwC）— 即使不是FAANG，这些名字在recruiter脑中有可信度
- 提到你在Vancouver — 让本地recruiter优先看到

---

## 2. ABOUT SECTION（2000字符以内）

这是你讲故事的地方。不要写成简历复述。结构：Hook → Value → Proof → Call to Action

### 推荐文案（直接copy-paste到LinkedIn）

```
I build machine learning systems that drive real business outcomes.

Over the past 10+ years, I've worked at the intersection of data science, AI, and business strategy — from scaling Uber China's growth analytics (5% → 30% market share) to deploying production ML models for quantitative trading, to building NLP-powered AI agents for a Sequoia-backed InsurTech startup.

What I bring to the table:

📊 End-to-End ML: Designed and deployed LightGBM, Graph Neural Networks, reinforcement learning agents, and NLP pipelines from research to production.

📈 Experimentation & Causal Inference: Led large-scale A/B testing programs, pricing elasticity experiments, and uplift modeling at Uber — driving data-informed decisions on dispatching, surge pricing, and user segmentation.

🤖 AI Products: Co-developed NLP-powered chatbots and AI sales assistants at Shiyibei (backed by Sequoia, Ctrip, Qunar), achieving 2.5x sales conversion improvement for MetLife.

💼 Business Strategy: 4 years at PwC Management Consulting, supporting M&A transactions including Haier's acquisition of Sanyo (2012 China M&A Service Award), and conducting growth strategy for Fortune 500 clients.

🔬 Current Work: Research Data Analyst at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), applying computational modeling and multi-omics data integration to cancer metabolism research. Pursuing M.S. in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) at NYIT Vancouver.

I'm currently based in Vancouver, BC, and seeking Data Scientist, ML Engineer, or AI Consultant opportunities where I can combine my technical depth with business acumen to solve high-impact problems.

Tech: Python, SQL, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, LightGBM, NLP, GNN, SHAP
Methods: A/B Testing, Causal Inference, Time Series, Reinforcement Learning, Statistical Modeling
